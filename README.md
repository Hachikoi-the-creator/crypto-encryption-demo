# Project desc

- Select a pk & generate a publicKey value
- Sign the message with the pk, i the server verify that the message has a correct signature made with the correct publicKey
  - Do the transaction
- what if somehow can send the timestamp alongside the signed message then I can get the signature in the sere thus avoid some double spending or account draining?

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Todo

```tsx
// * cannot pass round signedMsg so need to sign it again, there may be a better solution...
export const verifySignature = (msgHash: Uint8Array, username: Username) => {
  const signedMsg = secp256k1.sign(msgHash, ACCOUNTS[SENDER].private);
  const publicKey = ACCOUNTS[username].public;
  const isValid = secp256k1.verify(signedMsg, msgHash, publicKey);

  return isValid;
};
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
